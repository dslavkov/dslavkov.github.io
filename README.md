![example workflow](https://github.com/cryptozealot/cryptozealot.github.io/actions/workflows/pages.yml/badge.svg)

Automatic Build of Hugo website using hugo-resume theme with Github Actions Pipeline and Deploy to Github pages..

To create your own free website at "{yourgituser}.github.io":
1. Fork this repo and rename it while being forked
2. Rename the repository to {yourgituser}.github.io
3. IMPORTANT: While at your new repo, Go to Settings > Go to Pages > At "Build and deployment - Source" select "Github Actions" from the dropdown!
4. IMPORTANT: While at your new repo, Go to Settings > Go to Actions > Click Enable Actions
5. Do a manual change in one of the files to force a commit and start the pipeline. Just change something in config.toml
6. Go to {yourgituser}.github.io <br><br>
<B>(optional for netlify)</B><br><br>
6. Register and create a new site at Netlify. Edit --baseURL in netlify.toml to match your newly created site in netlify.<br>
7. To refresh pages in GithubPages we need to recompile our theme inside themes/ folder each time we run the pipeline<br> https://github.com/cryptozealot/cryptozealot.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/pages.yml#L48
Netlify needs that created in the repo prior to the deploy(maybe there is a fix for this - TODO)
So before we run Netlify Deployment, we clone our repo locally and cd into it, then we run:

```git submodule add https://github.com/cryptozealot/cryptozealot.github.io.git /themes/hugo-resume/```

Changes made to original repo:
1. Added .github/workflows/ "Github Actions" workflow to build and deploy on Github Pages.
2. Added netlify.toml - for Netlify deployment and admin panel
3. Created theme file, moved folders from exampleSite, cleanup
